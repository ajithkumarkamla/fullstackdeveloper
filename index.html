<p>A full-stack developer is a software professional with the skills to build both the <b>front-end (user interface)</b> and the <i>back-end (server, database, and logic) of a web application</i>.<br><br><hr>
They work across the entire "stack" of technologies, which includes languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and server-side languages such as Python, Java, or Node.js, along with databases, for the back-end. This versatility allows them to manage the entire software development lifecycle, from concept to implementation, and take ownership of projects.   </p>
